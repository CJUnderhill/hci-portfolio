## Welcome to my Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio!

This page contains a collection of my work for WPI's CS3041 (HCI) course. This class put a major focus on gaining a better understanding of both humans and technology, and how technological design can encourage certain behaviors from their users. We explored design and its effect on human behavior across a variety of topics.

### About Me

My name is Chad Underhill, and I'm a senior pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I have several years of experience in designing web-based applications, including an administration dashboard for a fortune 10 company's SaaS product, Sigma Pi Gamma-Iota's official website, and other smaller projects.

### My Work

Below are some samples of my work for this course. If you're interested, you can read more about my design process [here](https://medium.com/@chad.j.underhill/my-design-manifesto-fa59420882a8).

- [Tailoring the design of an existing website for a specific user and use-case](https://medium.com/@chad.j.underhill/redesigning-technocopias-mobile-website-for-adult-professionals-interested-in-digital-fabrication-e481e7ba7df4).

We re-designed the the Technocopia mobile website to better function for a hyper-specific demographinc: skilled laborers, aged 25 to 50, who wanted to learn more about digital fabrication techniques. We placed a big focus on ease-of-use and organization of information - and completely overhauled the navigational menu and content of several pages to do so.

- [Finding different ways to display visual information in order to influence user understanding](https://medium.com/@chad.j.underhill/design-for-understanding-a1e95249cb66).

We worked with the [CORGIS Database "Billionaires" dataset](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/billionaires/billionaires.html) to display data about the world's richest individuals through several different lenses. One displayed the data in a straightforward manner, but the other was intended to persuade users into finding a set of "commonalities" between the billionaires.

- [Building a chatbot to navigate the discussion of a tense topic](https://medium.com/@chad.j.underhill/design-for-tension-reflection-9339462f21da).

We built a chatbot that attempts to convince users to become pro-nuclear energy in their community. Using a series of persuasive facts and logical reasoning, it attempts to address any concerns about nuclear energy that the user might have. If the user already supports nuclear energy, it provides resources to help the user spread the word about its benefits.

- [Designing a webapp that attempt to improve a userâ€™s life by reading their emotions/actions](https://medium.com/@chad.j.underhill/design-for-wellbeing-reflection-9a56765496cd).

We built an app that can detect whether if a user is falling asleep while working at their computer. When they do, the app gently wakes them up and suggests a healthy activity to get them away from the screen for a bit - like taking a nap or getting some water to drink.

- [Creating a VR interface that gives users a new perspective on technology]().
