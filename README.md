## Welcome to my Human-Computer Interaction Portfolio!

This page contains a collection of my work for WPI's CS3041 (HCI) course. This class put a major focus on gaining a better understanding of both humans and technology, and how technological design can encourage certain behaviors from their users. We explored design and its effect on human behavior across a variety of topics.
